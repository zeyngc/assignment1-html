    <h2>Verse 1 : Gerard Way</h2> <!-- subheading -->
    <p>Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
      And you never had a chance Love it or leave it, you can't understand
      A pretty face, but you do so carry on
      And on, and on I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
      I'm just the way that the doctor made me
      On, and on, and on, and on
      Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door
      What's life like bleeding on the floor, the floor, the floor?</p> <!-- paragraph for 1st verse -->

  <section> <!-- section 2 -->
    <h2>Chorus : Gerard Way</h2>
    <p>You'll never make me leave I wear this on my sleeve
      Give me a reason to believe
      <mark>So give me all your poison
      And give me all your pills
      And give me all your hopeless hearts
        And make me ill </mark> <!-- highlighting guitar riff change to show mark element -->
      You're running after something that you'll never kill
      If this is what you want, then fire at will</p> <!-- using mark to highlight text -->
